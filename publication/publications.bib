abstract = {Humans race drones faster and more agile than algorithms, despite being limited to a fixed camera angle, body rate control, and response latencies in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. A better understanding of the ability of human pilots of selecting appropriate motor commands from highly dynamic visual information may provide key insights for solving current challenges in vision-based autonomous navigation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between flight performance, control behavior, and eye movements of human pilots in a drone racing task. We collected a multimodal dataset from 21 experienced drone pilots using a highly realistic drone racing simulator, also used to recruit professional pilots. Our results showed task-specific improvements in drone racing performance over time. Gaze fixations not only tracked future waypoints but also anticipated the future flight path. Cross-correlation analysis showed a strong spatio-temporal relationship between eye movements, camera orienting behavior, and thrust vector control. These results highlight the importance of coordinated eye movements in human-piloted drone racing.},

abstract = {When we read, our eyes move through the text in a series of fixations and high-velocity saccades to extract visual information. This process allows the brain to obtain meaning, e.g., about sentiment, or the emotional valence, expressed in the written text. How exactly the brain extracts the sentiment of single words during naturalistic reading is largely unknown. This is due to the challenges of naturalistic imaging, which has previously led researchers to employ highly controlled, timed word-by-word presentations of custom reading materials that lack ecological validity. Here, we aimed to assess the electrical neural correlates of word sentiment processing during naturalistic reading of English sentences. We used a publicly available dataset of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking recordings, and word-level semantic annotations from 7129 words in 400 sentences (Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus; Hollenstein et al., 2018). We computed fixation-related potentials (FRPs), which are evoked electrical responses time-locked to the onset of fixations. A general linear mixed model analysis of FRPs cleaned from visual- and motor-evoked activity showed a topographical difference between the positive and negative sentiment condition in the 224–304 ​ms interval after fixation onset in left-central and right-posterior electrode clusters. An additional analysis that included word-, phrase-, and sentence-level sentiment predictors showed the same FRP differences for the word-level sentiment, but no additional FRP differences for phrase- and sentence-level sentiment. Furthermore, decoding analysis that classified word sentiment (positive or negative) from sentiment-matched 40-trial average FRPs showed a 0.60 average accuracy (95{\%} confidence interval: [0.58, 0.61]). Control analyses ruled out that these results were based on differences in eye movements or linguistic features other than word sentiment. Our results extend previous research by showing that the emotional valence of lexico-semantic stimuli evoke a fast electrical neural response upon word fixation during naturalistic reading. These results provide an important step to identify the neural processes of lexico-semantic processing in ecologically valid conditions and can serve to improve computer algorithms for natural language processing.},

abstract = {Neuropsychological studies indicate that healthy aging is associated with a decline of inhibitory control of at-tentional and behavioral systems. A widely accepted measure of inhibitory control is the antisaccade task that requires both the inhibition of a reflexive saccadic response toward a visual target and the initiation of a voluntary eye movement in the opposite direction. To better understand the nature of age-related differences in inhibitory control, we evaluated antisaccade task performance in 78 younger (20–35 years) and 78 older (60– 80 years) participants. In order to provide reliable estimates of inhibitory control for individual subjects, we investigated test–retest reliability of the reaction time, error rate, saccadic gain, and peak saccadic velocity and further estimated latent, not directly observable processed contributing to changes in the antisaccade task ex-ecution. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for an older group of participants emerged as good to excellent for most of our antisaccade task measures. Furthermore, using Bayesian multivariate models, we in-spected age-related differences in the performances of healthy younger and older participants. The older group demonstrated higher error rates, longer reaction times, significantly more inhibition failures, and late prosaccades as compared with young adults. The consequently lower ability of older adults to voluntarily inhibit saccadic responses has been interpreted as an indicator of age-related inhibitory control decline. Additionally, we performed a Bayesian model comparison of used computational models and concluded that the Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition and Late Action (SERIA) model explains our data better than PRO-Stop-Antisaccade (PROSA) that does not incorporate a late decision process.},

abstract = {Objective: In patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), properties of functional brain networks at rest are informative of the degree of consciousness impairment and of long-term outcome. Here we investigate whether connectivity differences between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcome are already present within 24 h of coma onset. Methods: We prospectively recorded 63-channel electroencephalography (EEG) at rest during the first day of coma after cardiac arrest. We analyzed 98 adults, of whom 57 survived beyond unresponsive wakefulness. Functional connectivity was estimated by computing the ‘debiased weighted phase lag index' over epochs of five seconds duration. We evaluated the network's topological features, including clustering coefficient, path length, modularity and participation coefficient and computed their variance over time. Finally, we estimated the predictive value of these topological features for patients' outcomes by splitting the patient sample in training and test datasets. Results: Group-level analysis revealed lower clustering coefficient, higher modularity and path length variance in patients with favorable compared to those with unfavorable outcomes (p {\textless} 0.01). Within all features, the path length variance in the network provided the best positive predictive value (PPV) for favorable outcome and specificity for unfavorable outcome in the test dataset (PPV: 0.83, p {\textless} 0.01; specificity: 0.86, p {\textless} 0.01) with above-chance negative predictive value and accuracy. Of note, the exclusion of patients with epileptiform activity (20 in total) eliminates all false positive predictions (n = 6) for path length variance. Interpretation: Topological features of functional connectivity differ as a function of long-term outcome in patients on the first day of coma. These differences are not interpretable in terms of consciousness levels as all patients were in a deep unconscious state. The time variance of path length is informative of comatose patients' outcome, as patients with favorable outcome exhibit a richer repertoire of path length than those with unfavorable outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Outcome prediction in comatose patients following cardiac arrest remains challenging. Here, we assess the predictive performance of electroencephalography-based power spectra within 24 h from coma onset. Methods: We acquired electroencephalography (EEG) from comatose patients (n = 138) on the first day of coma in four hospital sites in Switzerland. Outcome was categorised as favourable or unfavourable based on the best state within three months. Data were split in training and test sets. We evaluated the predictive performance of EEG power spectra for long term outcome and its added value to standard clinical tests. Results: Out of 138 patients, 80 had a favourable outcome. Power spectra comparison between favourable and unfavourable outcome in the training set yielded significant differences at 5.2–13.2 Hz and above 21 Hz. Outcome prediction based on power at 5.2–13.2 Hz was accurate in training and test sets. Overall, power spectra predicted patients' outcome with maximum specificity and positive predictive value: 1.00 (95{\%} with CI: 0.94–1.00 and 0.89–1.00, respectively). The combination of power spectra and reactivity yielded better accuracy and sensitivity (0.81, 95{\%} CI: 0.71–0.89) than prediction based on power spectra alone. Conclusions: On the first day of coma following cardiac arrest, low power spectra values around 10 Hz, typically linked to impaired cortico-thalamic structural connections, are highly specific of unfavourable outcome. Peaks in this frequency range can predict long-term outcome.},

abstract = {Aim: To assess whether stimulus-induced modifications of electromyographic activity observed on scalp EEG have a prognostic value in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Methods: 184 adult patients from a multi-centric prospective register who underwent an early EEG after cardiac arrest were included. Auditory and somatosensory stimulation was performed during EEG-recording. EEG reactivity (EEG-R) and EMG reactivity (EMG-R) were retrospectively assessed visually by board-certified electroencephalographers, and compared with clinical outcome (cerebral performance category, CPC) at three months. A favorable functional outcome was defined as CPC 1–2, an unfavorable outcome as CPC 3–5. Results: Both EEG-R and EMG-R were predictors for good outcome (EEG-R accuracy 72{\%} (95{\%}-CI 66–79), sensitivity 86{\%} (78–93), specificity 60{\%} (50–69); EMG-R accuracy 65{\%} (58–72), sensitivity 61{\%} (51–75), specificity 69{\%} (60–78)). When reactivity was defined as EEG-R and/or EMG-R, the accuracy was 73{\%} (67–70), the sensitivity 94{\%} (90–99), and the specificity 53{\%} (43–63). Conclusion: Taking EMG into account when assessing reactivity of EEG seems to reduce false negative predictions for identifying patients with favorable outcome after cardiac arrest.},

abstract = {Background: Targeted temperature management (TTM) represents the standard of care in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest (CA) and may be applied targeting 33° or 36 °C. While multimodal prognostication has been extensively tested for 33 °C, scarce information exists for 36 °C. Methods: In this cohort study, consecutive comatose adults after CA treated with TTM at 36 °C between July 2014 and October 2016 were included. A combination of neurological examination, electrophysiological features, and serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was evaluated for outcome prediction at 3 months (mortality; good outcome defined as cerebral performance categories (CPC) score of 1–2, poor outcome defined as CPC 3–5). Results: We analyzed 61 patients. The presence of two or more predictors out of, unreactive electroencephalogram (EEG) background, epileptiform EEG, absent pupillary and/or corneal reflex, early myoclonus, bilaterally absent cortical somatosensory evoked potentials, and serum NSE {\textgreater}75 $\mu$g/l, had a high specificity for predicting mortality (positive predictive value [PPV] = 1.00, 95{\%} CI 0.87–1.00) and poor outcome (PPV = 1.00, 95{\%} CI 0.80–1.00). Reactive EEG background was highly sensitive for predicting good outcome (0.95, 95{\%} CI 0.74–0.99). Conclusions: Prediction of outcome after CA and TTM targeting 36 °C seems valid in adults using the same features tested at 33 °C. A reactive EEG under TTM appears highly sensitive for good outcome.},

abstract = {Human–environment interactions are mediated through the body and occur within the peripersonal space (PPS), the space immediately adjacent to and surrounding the body. The PPS is taken to be a critical interface between the body and the environment, and indeed, body-part specific PPS remapping has been shown to depend on body-part utilization, such as upper limb movements in otherwise static observers. How vestibular signals induced by whole-body movement contribute to PPS representation is less well understood. In a series of experiments, we mapped the spatial extension of the PPS around the head while participants were submitted to passive whole-body rotations inducing vestibular stimulation. Forty-six participants, in three experiments, executed a tactile detection reaction time task while task-irrelevant auditory stimuli approached them. The maximal distance at which the auditory stimulus facilitated tactile reaction time was taken as a proxy for the boundary of peri-head space. The present results indicate two distinct vestibular effects. First, vestibular stimulation speeded tactile detection indicating a vestibular facilitation of somatosensory processing. Second, vestibular stimulation modulated audio-tactile interaction of peri-head space in a rotation direction-specific manner. Congruent but not incongruent audio-vestibular motion stimuli expanded the PPS boundary further away from the body as compared to no rotation. These results show that vestibular inputs dynamically update the multisensory delineation of PPS and far space, which may serve to maintain accurate tracking of objects close to the body and to update spatial self-representations.},

Methods: Electroencephalography responses to frequent and rare stimuli were obtained from 66 patients on the first and second day after coma onset. Results: Multivariate decoding analysis revealed an above chance-level auditory discrimination in 25 patients on the first day and in 31 patients on the second day. Tactile discrimination was significant in 16 patients on the first day and in 23 patients on the second day. Single-day sensory discrimination was unrelated to patients' outcome in both modalities. However, improvement of auditory discrimination from first to the second day was predictive of good outcome with a positive predictive power (PPV) of 0.73 (CI = 0.52–0.88). Analyses considering the improvement of tactile, auditory and tactile, or either auditory or tactile discrimination showed no significant prediction of good outcome (PPVs = 0.58–0.68). Interpretation: Our results show that in the acute phase of coma deviance detection is largely preserved for both auditory and tactile modalities.

abstract = {Background Outcome prognostication in postanoxic comatose patients is more accurate in predicting poor than good recovery. Using electroencephalography recordings in patients treated with targeted temperature management at 33 °C (TTM 33), we have previously shown that improvement in auditory discrimination over the first days of coma predicted awakening. Given the increased application of a 36 °C temperature target (TTM 36), here we aimed at validating the predictive value of auditory discrimination in the TTM 36 setting. Methods In this prospective multicenter study, we analyzed the EEG responses to auditory stimuli from 60 consecutive patients from the first and second coma day. A semiautomatic decoding analysis was applied to single patient data to quantify discrimination performance between frequently repeated and deviant sounds. The decoding change from the first to second day was used for predicting patient outcome. Results We observed an increase in auditory discrimination in 25 out of 60 patients. Among them, 17 awoke from coma (68{\%} positive predictive value; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.46–0.85). By excluding patients with electroencephalographic epileptiform features, 15 of 18 exhibited improvement in auditory discrimination (83{\%} positive predictive value; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.59–0.96). Specificity of good outcome prediction increased after adding auditory discrimination to EEG reactivity. Conclusion These results suggest that tracking of auditory discrimination over time is informative of good recovery independent of the temperature target. This quantitative test provides complementary information to existing clinical tools by identifying patients with high chances of recovery and encouraging the maintenance of life support.},

Neuroimaging studies mainly investigated regularity processing for exteroceptive sensory inputs (i.e. from outside the body). Here we investigated whether interoceptive signals (i.e. from inside the body) can mediate auditory regularity processing. Human participants passively listened to sound sequences presented in synchrony or asynchrony to their heartbeat while concomitant electroencephalography was recorded. We hypothesized that the cardio-audio synchronicity would induce a brain expectation of future sounds. Electrical neuroimaging analysis revealed a surprise response at 158-270 ms upon omission of the expected sounds in the synchronous condition only. Control analyses ruled out that this effect was trivially based on expectation from the auditory temporal structure or on differences in heartbeat physiological signals. Implicit neural monitoring of temporal regularities across interoceptive and exteroceptive signals drives prediction of future events in auditory sequences.},

Such research revealed that heartbeat signals affect sensory (e.g., visual) processing: however, it is unknown how they impact the perception of body images. Here we linked our participants' heartbeat to visual stimuli and investigated the spatio-temporal brain dynamics of cardio-visual stimulation on the processing of human body images. We recorded visual evoked potentials with 64-channel electroencephalography while showing a body or a scrambled-body (control) that appeared at the frequency of the on-line recorded participants' heartbeat or not (not-synchronous, control). Extending earlier studies, we found a body-independent effect, with cardiac signals enhancing visual processing during two time periods (77–130 ms and 145–246 ms). Within the second (later) time-window we detected a second effect characterised by enhanced activity in parietal, temporo-occipital, inferior frontal, and right basal ganglia-insula regions, but only when non-scrambled body images were flashed synchronously with the heartbeat (208–224 ms). In conclusion, our results highlight the role of interoceptive information for the visual processing of human body pictures within a network integrating cardio-visual signals of relevance for perceptual and cognitive aspects of visual body processing.},

In humans, vestibular stimulation activates several somatosensory brain regions and improves tactile perception. However, less is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of such vestibular-somatosensory interactions in the human brain. To address this issue, we recorded high-density electroencephalography during left median nerve electrical stimulation to obtain Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs). We analyzed SEPs during vestibular activation following sudden decelerations from constant-velocity (90°/s and 60°/s) earth-vertical axis yaw rotations and SEPs during a non-vestibular control period. SEP analysis revealed two distinct temporal effects of vestibular activation: An early effect (28-32 ms post-stimulus) characterized by vestibular suppression of SEP response strength that depended on rotation velocity and a later effect (97-112 ms post-stimulus) characterized by vestibular modulation of SEP topographical pattern that was rotation velocity-independent. Source estimation localized these vestibular effects, during both time periods, to activation differences in a distributed cortical network including the right postcentral gyrus, right insula, left precuneus, and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex. These results suggest that vestibular-somatosensory interactions in humans depend on processing in specific time periods in somatosensory and vestibular cortical regions.},

abstract = {Why should a scientist whose aim is to unravel the neural mechanisms of perception consider brain-body interactions seriously? Brain-body interactions have traditionally been associated with emotion, effort, or stress, but not with the “cold” processes of perception and attention. Here, we review recent experimental evidence suggesting a different picture: the neural monitoring of bodily state, and in particular the neural monitoring of the heart, affects visual perception. The impact of spontaneous fluctuations of neural responses to heartbeats on visual detection is as large as the impact of explicit manipulations of spatial attention in perceptual tasks. However, we propose that the neural monitoring of visceral inputs plays a specific role in conscious perception, distinct from the role of attention. The neural monitoring of organs such as the heart or the gut would generate a subject-centered reference frame, from which the first-person perspective inherent to conscious perception can develop. In this view, conscious perception results from the integration of visual content with first-person perspective.},

abstract = {A fundamental component of conscious experience involves a first-person perspective (1PP), characterized by the experi- ence of being a subject and of being directed at the world. Extending earlier work on multisensory perceptual mechanisms of 1PP, we here asked whether the experienced direction of the 1PP (i.e. the spatial direction of subjective experience of the world) depends on visual-tactile-vestibular conflicts, including the direction of gravity. Sixteen healthy subjects in supine position received visuo-tactile synchronous or asynchronous stroking to induce a full-body illusion. In the critical manipu- lation, we presented gravitational visual object motion directed toward or away from the participant's body and thus con- gruent or incongruent with respect to the direction of vestibular and somatosensory gravitational cues. The results showed that multisensory gravitational conflict induced within-subject changes of the experienced direction of the 1PP that de- pended on the direction of visual gravitational cues. Participants experienced more often a downward direction of their 1PP (incongruent with respect to the participant's physical body posture) when visual object motion was directed away rather than towards the participant's body. These downward-directed 1PP experiences positively correlated with measures of ele- vated self-location. Together, these results show that visual gravitational cues contribute to the experienced direction of the 1PP, defining the subjective location and perspective from where humans experience to perceive the world.},

Another line of research has highlighted the importance of signals from the inside of the body (e.g., visceral signals) and proposed that neural representations of internal bodily signals underlie self-consciousness, which to date has been based on philosophical inquiry, clinical case studies, and behavioral studies. Here, we investigated the relationship of bodily self-consciousness with the neural processing of internal bodily signals. By combining electrical neuroimaging, analysis of peripheral physiological signals, and virtual reality technology in humans, we show that transient modulations of neural responses to heartbeats in the posterior cingulate cortex covary with changes in bodily self-consciousness induced by the full-body illusion. Additional analyses excluded that measured basic cardiorespiratory parameters or interoceptive sensitivity traits could account for this finding. These neurophysiological data link experimentally the cortical mapping of the internal body to selfconsciousness.},

abstract = {Bodily self-consciousness (BSC) refers to experience of one's self as located within an owned body (self-identification) and as occupying a specific location in space (self-location). BSC can be altered through multisensory stimulation, as in the Full Body Illusion (FBI). If participants view a virtual body from a distance being stroked, while receiving synchronous tactile stroking on their physical body, they feel as if the virtual body were their own and they experience, subjectively, to drift toward the virtual body. Here we hypothesized that - while normally the experience of the body in space depends on the integration of multisensory body-related signals within a limited space surrounding the body (i.e. peripersonal space, PPS) - during the FBI the boundaries of PPS would shift toward the virtual body, that is, toward the position of experienced self-location. To test this hypothesis, we used synchronous visuo-tactile stroking to induce the FBI, as contrasted with a control condition of asynchronous stroking. Concurrently, we applied an audio-tactile interaction paradigm to estimate the boundaries of PPS. PPS was measured in front of and behind the participants' body as the distance where tactile information interacted with auditory stimuli looming in space toward the participant's physical body. We found that during synchronous stroking, i.e. when participants experienced the FBI, PPS boundaries extended in the front-space, toward the avatar, and concurrently shrunk in the back-space, as compared to the asynchronous stroking control condition, when FBI was induced. These findings support the view that during the FBI, PPS boundaries translate toward the virtual body, such that the PPS representation shifts from being centered at the location of the physical body to being now centered at the subjectively experienced location of the self.},

abstract = {This commentary aims to find the right description of the pre-reflective brain mechanisms underlying our phenomenal experience of being a subject bound to a physical body (bodily self) and basic cognitive, perceptual, and subjective aspects related to interaction with other individuals (social cognition). I will focus on the proposal by Gallese and Cuccio that embodied simulation, in terms of motor resonance, is the primary brain mechanism underlying the pre-reflective aspects of social cognition and the bodily self. I will argue that this proposal is too narrow to serve a unified theory of the neurobiological mechanisms of both target phenomena. I support this criticism with theoretical considerations and empirical evidence suggesting that multisensory spatial processing, which is distinct from but a pre-requisite of motor resonance, substantially contributes to the bodily self and social cognition. My commentary is structured in three sections. The first section addresses social cognition and compares embodied simulation to an alternative account, namely the attention schema theory. According to this theory we pre-reflectively empathize with others by predicting their current state of attention which involves predicting the spatial focus of attention. Thereby we derive a representational model of their state of mind. On this account, spatial coding of attention, rather than motor resonance, is the primary mechanism underlying social cognition. I take this as a theoretical alternative complementing motor resonance mechanisms. The second section focuses on the bodily self. Comparison of the brain net- works of the bodily self and social cognition reveals strong overlap, suggesting that both phenomena depend on shared multisensory and sensorimotor mechanisms. I will review recent empirical data about altered states of the bodily self in terms of self-location and the first-person perspective. These spatial aspects of the bodily self are encoded in brain regions distinct from the brain network of em- bodied simulation. I argue that while motor resonance might contribute to body ownership and agency, it does not account for spatial aspects of the bodily self. Thus, embodied simulation appears to be a necessary but insufficiently “primary” brain mechanism of the bodily self and social cognition. The third section discusses the contributions of the vestibular system, i.e., the sensory system encoding head motion and gravity, to the bodily self and social cognition. Vestibular cortical processing seems relevant to both processes, be- cause it directly encodes the world-centered direction of gravity and allows us to distinguish between motions of the own body and motions of other individuals and the external world. Furthermore, the vestibular cortical network largely overlaps with those neural networks relevant to the bodily self and social cognition. Thus, the vestibular system may play a crucial role in multisensory spatial coding relating the bodily self to other individuals in the external world.},

abstract = {Self-consciousness is the remarkable human experience of being a subject: the "I". Self-consciousness is typically bound to a body, and particularly to the spatial dimensions of the body, as well as to its location and displacement in the gravitational field. Because the vestibular system encodes head position and movement in three-dimensional space, vestibular cortical processing likely contributes to spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness. We review here recent data showing vestibular effects on first-person perspective (the feeling from where "I" experience the world) and self-location (the feeling where "I" am located in space). We compare these findings to data showing vestibular effects on mental spatial transformation, self-motion perception, and body representation showing vestibular contributions to various spatial representations of the body with respect to the external world. Finally, we discuss the role for four posterior brain regions that process vestibular and other multisensory signals to encode spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness: temporoparietal junction, parietoinsular vestibular cortex, ventral intraparietal region, and medial superior temporal region. We propose that vestibular processing in these cortical regions is critical in linking multisensory signals from the body (personal and peripersonal space) with external (extrapersonal) space. Therefore, the vestibular system plays a critical role for neural representations of spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pfeiffer, Serino and Blanke.},

abstract = {Self-consciousness is based on multisensory signals from the body. In full-body illusion (FBI) experiments, multisensory conflict was used to induce changes in three key aspects of bodily self-consciousness (BSC): self-identification (which body ‘I' identify with), self-location (where ‘I' am located), and first-person perspective (from where ‘I' experience the world; 1PP). Here, we adapted a previous FBI protocol in which visuotactile stroking was administered by a robotic device (tactile stroking) and simultaneously rendered on the back of a virtual body (visual stroking) that participants viewed on a head-mounted display as if filmed from a posterior viewpoint of a camera. We compared the effects of two different visuospatial viewpoints on the FBI and thereby on these key aspects of BSC. During control manipulations, participants saw a no-body object instead of a virtual body (first experiment) or received asynchronous versus synchronous visuotactile stroking (second experiment). Results showed that within-subjects visuospatial viewpoint manipulations affected the subjective 1PP ratings if a virtual body was seen but had no effect for viewing a non-body object. However, visuospatial viewpoint had no effect on self-identification, but depended on the viewed object and visuotactile synchrony. Self-location depended on visuospatial viewpoint (first experiment) and visuotactile synchrony (second experiment). Our results show that the visuospatial viewpoint from which the virtual body is seen during FBIs modulates the subjective 1PP and that such viewpoint manipulations contribute to spatial aspects of BSC. We compare the present data with recent data revealing vestibular contributions to the subjective 1PP and discuss the multisensory nature of BSC and the subjective 1PP.},

abstract = {Looking at one's own body has been shown to induce analgesia. In the present work we investigated whether illusory self-identification with an avatar, as induced experimentally through visuo-tactile stimulation, modulates the response to painful stimuli. In 30 healthy volunteers, a robotic device was used to stroke the participants' back, while they viewed either the body of an avatar, a non-body object (control object), or a body avatar with scrambled body parts (control body). All were visually stimulated in either congruent or incongruent fashion with the participant's body. We collected physiological responses (skin conductance response: SCR) to painful stimuli delivered to the participant's hand and responses to a questionnaire inquiring about self-identification with the avatar. We expected reduced physiological responses to pain during the observation of a body avatar only during synchronous visuo-tactile stroking and no reduction for the control object and the control body.Results showed a reduced SCR to painful stimuli when participants observed the normal body avatar being stroked synchronously that was also associated with largest self-identification ratings recordable already during the pain anticipation. Moreover, a negative correlation between self-identification and SCR was observed, suggesting that a greater degree of self-identification with the avatar was associated with larger decreases in SCR. These results suggest that during states of illusory self-identification with the avatar, the vision of an alien body (anatomically compatible for the vision and congruently stroked for the touch) is effective in modulating physiological responses to painful stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Robotic visuo-tactile stimulation was administered to 78 participants in three experiments. Additionally, we presented participants with a virtual body as seen from an elevated and downward-directed perspective while they were lying supine and were therefore receiving vestibular and postural cues about an upward-directed perspective. Under these conditions, we studied the effects of different degrees of visuo-vestibular conflict, repeated measurements during illusion induction, and the relationship to a classical measure of visuo-vestibular integration. Extending earlier findings on experimentally induced changes in bodily self-consciousness, we show that self-identification does not depend on the experienced direction of the first-person perspective, whereas self-location does. Changes in bodily self-consciousness depend on visual gravitational signals. Individual differences in the experienced direction of first-person perspective correlated with individual differences in visuo-vestibular integration. Our data reveal important contributions of visuo-vestibular gravitational cues to bodily self-consciousness. In particular we show that the experienced direction of the first-person perspective depends on the integration of visual, vestibular, and tactile signals, as well as on individual differences in idiosyncratic visuo-vestibular strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Pfeiffer et al.},

abstract = {A central feature of our consciousness is the experience of the self as a unified entity residing in a physical body, termed bodily self-consciousness. This phenomenon includes aspects such as the sense of owning a body (also known as body ownership) and has been suggested to arise from the integration of sensory and motor signals from the body. Several studies have shown that temporally synchronous tactile stimulation of the real body and visual stimulation of a fake or virtual body can induce changes in bodily self-consciousness, typically resulting in a sense of illusory ownership over the fake body. The present study assessed the effect of anatomical congruency of visuo-tactile stimulation on bodily self-consciousness. A virtual body was presented and temporally synchronous visuo-tactile stroking was applied simultaneously the participants' body and to the virtual body. We manipulated the anatomical locations of the visuo-tactile stroking (i.e. on the back, on the leg), resulting in congruent stroking (stroking was felt and seen on the back or the leg) or incongruent stroking (i.e. stroking was felt on the leg and seen on the back). We measured self-identification with the virtual body and self-location as well as skin temperature. Illusory self-identification with the avatar as well as changes in self-localization were experienced in the congruent stroking conditions. Participants showed a decrease in skin temperature across several body locations during congruent stimulation. These data establish that the full-body illusion alters bodily self-consciousness and instigates widespread physiological changes in the participant's body. {\textcopyright} 2013 Salomon, Lim, Pfeiffer, Gassert and Blanke.},

Accordingly, at present it is unclear if the hierarchical principle applies to learning the use of novel objects as well. In the present study we found that when learning to use a novel object subjects acquired an action representation of the end location associated with using the object, as evidenced by slower responses in an action observation task, when the object was presented at an incorrect end location.

abstract = {Humans experience the self as localized within their body. This aspect of bodily self-consciousness can be experimentally manipulated by exposing individuals to conflicting multisensory input, or can be abnormal following focal brain injury. Recent technological developments helped to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration and self-location, but the neural underpinnings are still under investigation, and the manual application of stimuli resulted in large variability difficult to control. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an MR-compatible stroking device capable of presenting moving tactile stimuli to both legs and the back of participants lying on a scanner bed while acquiring functional neuroimaging data. The platform consists of four independent stroking devices with a travel of 16-20 cm and a maximum stroking velocity of 15 cm/s, actuated over non-magnetic ultrasonic motors. Complemented with virtual reality, this setup provides a unique research platform allowing to investigate multisensory integration and its effects on self-location under well-controlled experimental conditions. The MR-compatibility of the system was evaluated in both a 3 and a 7 Tesla scanner and showed negligible interference with brain imaging. In a preliminary study using a prototype device with only one tactile stimulator, fMRI data acquired on 12 healthy participants showed visuo-tactile synchrony-related and body-specific modulations of the brain activity in bilateral temporoparietal cortex. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Words denoting manipulable objects activate sensorimotor brain areas, likely reflecting action experience with the denoted objects. In particular, these sensorimotor lexical representations have been found to reflect the way in which an object is used. In the current paper we present data from two experiments (one behavioral and one neuroimaging) in which we investigate whether body schema information, putatively necessary for interacting with functional objects, is also recruited during lexical processing. To this end, we presented participants with words denoting objects that are typically brought towards or away from the body (e.g., cup or key, respectively). We hypothesized that objects typically brought to a location on the body (e.g., cup) are relatively more reliant on body schema representations, since the final goal location of the cup (i.e., the mouth) is represented primarily through posture and body co-ordinates. In contrast, objects typically brought to a location away from the body (e.g., key) are relatively more dependent on visuo-spatial representations, since the final goal location of the key (i.e., a keyhole) is perceived visually. The behavioral study showed that prior planning of a movement along an axis towards and away from the body facilitates processing of words with a congruent action semantic feature (i.e., preparation of movement towards the body facilitates processing of cup.). In an fMRI study we showed that words denoting objects brought towards the body engage the resources of brain areas involved in the processing information about human bodies (i.e., the extra-striate body area, middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal lobe) relatively more than words denoting objects typically brought away from the body. The results provide converging evidence that body schema are implicitly activated in processing lexical information. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
